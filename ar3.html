        <h3>Food Waste Data</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Food Waste:</span> In Ontario, households were estimated to waste a significant amount of food each year. Studies have shown that around 30-40% of food purchased by households ends up being wasted. This includes food that is discarded due to spoilage, overbuying, or not being used in time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Commercial Food Waste:</span> The commercial and industrial sectors also contribute to food wastage. Restaurants, supermarkets, and other businesses within the food supply chain are sources of significant food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Environmental Impact:</span> Food wastage has environmental consequences, including the unnecessary use of resources like water, land, and energy for the production and transportation of food that ultimately goes to waste. Food waste in landfills can also produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Food Rescue and Redistribution:</span> Various organizations and initiatives exist to rescue surplus food that would otherwise go to waste and redistribute it to those in need. These efforts play a role in reducing both food wastage and food insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get the most accurate and current food wastage statistics for Ontario, we recommend checking with sources like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA)</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Ontario Waste Management Association (OWMA)</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Research institutions like universities conducting studies on food waste</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Nonprofit organizations focused on food waste reduction and sustainability</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Annual Food Waste</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Ontario generated an estimated 3.9 million tonnes of food waste annually,</span> according to a study conducted by Second Harvest in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Per Capita Waste:</span> On a per capita basis, this equated to roughly 285 kilograms (628 pounds) of food waste per person per year.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Value of Wasted Food:</span> The value of food wasted in Ontario was estimated to be around $12 billion annually,</span> considering both residential and commercial food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Environmental Impact:</span> Food waste has significant environmental implications. It was estimated that the environmental footprint of food waste in Ontario included the emission of 3.2 million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Household Contribution:</span> Households were a major contributor to food waste in Ontario, accounting for approximately 60% of total food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Commercial and Industrial Contribution:</span> The commercial and industrial sectors, including restaurants, grocery stores, and food processing, were responsible for a significant portion of the remaining food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">Food Rescue Efforts:</span> Ontario also had active food rescue organizations and initiatives working to recover surplus food from various sources and redistribute it to those in need.
